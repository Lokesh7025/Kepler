# `@kepler/extension-skills`

This package implements the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).

Kepler looks for skills in:

1. `~/.kepler/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
2. `<workspace>/.kepler/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

A project skill replaces a global skill with the same name. Invalid skills stop session startup with an error that names the file and field. Frontmatter supports the required `name` and `description` fields plus `license`, `compatibility`, string-valued `metadata`, and the experimental `allowed-tools` field.

The startup prompt contains only skill metadata. The model uses the `skill` tool to load full instructions and reads referenced text files when needed. Canonical path checks prevent `..` and symlink escapes from the skill directory. `allowed-tools` is metadata and cannot widen Kepler's policy.
