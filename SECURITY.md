# Security policy

The [security assurance case](docs/security/assurance-case.md) lists Kepler's assets, trust boundaries, current controls, and known limits. Kepler has not published release artifacts yet. [Release verification](docs/security/release-verification.md) defines what must be in place before that happens.

## Supported versions

Kepler is still in pre-release development, so only the current `main` branch receives security fixes.

## Report a vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability.

Use GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting in the canonical repository when it is available. Otherwise, email `harisrini21@gmail.com`.

Include the affected revision, expected impact, reproduction steps, and any suggested fix. Do not send live credentials or private user data.

## Response targets

- Acknowledge the report within 48 hours
- Provide an initial assessment within 7 days
- Aim to resolve a confirmed issue within 30 days, depending on complexity

Sandbox escapes, permission bypasses, and credential exposure are severity-one issues. When in doubt, report privately.

Release notes will credit valid reports unless the reporter asks to remain anonymous.
